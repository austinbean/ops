This file is a list from the CDC with morphine MMEs for every 11 digit NDC code.
In that case it is probably better / more useful.

* opioids w/ MME from CDC, plus maybe some additions.  Source was pdmpassist.org  
	* If this list has all of the NDCs, then it's a better list anyway.  So: use this instead of what we already have.  Ask them to upload it as a table.
